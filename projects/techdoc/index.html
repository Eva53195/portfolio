        <header>Continents</header>
        <p>A continent is a large continuous landmass on Earth. 
          Traditionally, the world is divided into seven continents, 
          although in some models Europe and Asia are combined into
          a single  continent called Eurasia.</p>
        <p>Continents differ greatly in size, population, and 
          cultural diversity. Asia is the largest both in area 
          and population, while Australia is the smallest. Antarctica is unique because it does not have a permanent  human population.</p>
        <p> Studying continents helps us understand geography, 
          climate, human migration, and the distribution of
          natural resources across the planet.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Africa</li>
            <li>Antarctica</li>
            <li>Asia</li>
            <li>Australia</li>
            <li>Europe</li>
            <li>North America</li>
            <li>South America</li>
          </ul>
        <p>In programming, we can represent the list of continents 
          as an array or object. This is helpful when storing 
          and organizing data in applications related to geography.</p>
          <code>const continents =["Africa", "Antarctica", "Asia", "Australia", "Europe", "North America", "South America"];
          </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Countries">
        <header>Countries</header>
        <p> A country is a distinct territorial body recognized 
          as an independent nation. As of today, there are about 
          195 countries in the world.</p>
        <p>Each country has its own government, culture, economy,
          and often unique traditions. Some countries span across 
          multiple continents, such as Turkey (Europe and Asia).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brazil — South America</li>
            <li>Germany — Europe</li>
            <li>Japan — Asia</li>
            <li>Egypt — Africa</li>
          </ul>
        <p>In code, we can represent countries as objects with
          properties like name, continent, and population.</p>
          <code>const country = { name: "Japan", continent: "Asia", population: 125.7e6 };</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Capitals">
        <header>Capitals</header>
        <p>A capital city is the seat of government of a country. 
         It usually houses the main offices of state, parliament,
         and central institutions.</p>
        <p>Not all countries have just one capital. For example, 
          South Africa has three official capitals: Pretoria, 
          Cape Town, and Bloemfontein.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Paris — France</li>
            <li>Canberra — Australia</li>
            <li>Ottawa — Canada</li>
            <li>Brasília — Brazil</li>
          </ul>
        <p>In programming, capitals can be stored in objects 
          where the country is the key and the capital is the value.</p>
          <code>const capitals = { "France": "Paris", "Australia": "Canberra", "Canada": "Ottawa", "Brazil": "Brasília" };
          </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Oceans">
        <header>Oceans</header>
        <p>Oceans cover about 71% of Earth’s surface and are 
          essential for regulating climate and supporting life.</p>
        <p> There are five recognized oceans, the largest of which
          is the Pacific Ocean, and the smallest is the Arctic Ocean.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pacific Ocean</li>
            <li>Atlantic Ocean</li>
            <li>Indian Ocean</li>
            <li>Southern Ocean</li>
            <li>Arctic Ocean</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In code, we can represent oceans as an array to quickly 
          access and display them in applications.</p>
          <code>const oceans = ["Pacific", "Atlantic", "Indian", "Southern", "Arctic"];</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="World_Wonders">
        <header>World Wonders</header>
        <p>The term "World Wonders" refers to extraordinary 
          structures built by humans or created by nature. The 
          most famous list is the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p>
        <p> In 2007, a new list of Seven Wonders of the Modern World 
          was compiled based on a global poll.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Great Wall of China</li>
            <li>Petra, Jordan</li>
            <li>Christ the Redeemer, Brazil</li>
            <li>Machu Picchu, Peru</li>
            <li>Chichen Itza, Mexico</li>
            <li>Roman Colosseum, Italy</li>
            <li>Taj Mahal, India</li>
          </ul>
        <p>We can represent wonders as a JavaScript array of strings.</p>
          <code>const wonders = ["Great Wall of China", "Petra", "Christ the Redeemer", "Machu Picchu", "Chichen Itza", "Colosseum", "Taj Mahal"];

      <section class="main-section" id="Famous_Mountains">
        <header>Famous Mountains</header>
         <p>Mountains are natural elevations of the Earth's surface, 
           often forming ranges. They influence climate, biodiversity, 
           and human activities.</p>
         <p>Some mountains are famous for their height, beauty, or 
           cultural significance.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Mount Everest — 8,848 m</li>
           <li>Kilimanjaro — 5,895 m</li>
           <li>Mont Blanc — 4,809 m</li>
          </ul>
         <p>In programming, mountains can be represented as objects 
           containing name and height.</p>
          <code>const mountain = { name: "Mount Everest", height_m: 8848, location: "Nepal/China" };</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Major_Rivers">
        <header>Major Rivers</header>
         <p>Rivers are large natural streams of water flowing toward 
           oceans, seas, or lakes. They are vital for agriculture, 
           transportation, and ecosystems.</p>
         <p>The Nile and the Amazon are two of the most famous rivers, 
           often debated for the title of the longest river in the world.</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Nile — about 6,650 km</li>
           <li>Amazon — about 6,400 km</li>
           <li>Yangtze — about 6,300 km</li>
          </ul>
         <p>Rivers can be represented in code as objects with key 
           properties like name and length.</p>
         <code>const rivers = [ {name: "Nile", length_km: 6650}, {name: "Amazon", length_km: 6400}, {name: "Yangtze", length_km: 6300} ];</code>
